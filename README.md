# Snipbase [![Circle CI](https://img.shields.io/circleci/project/wryyl/snipbase.svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/wryyl/snipbase)

A social and collaborative code snippet manager with GitHub Gists integration.

Snipbase is a collaborative project between Timothy Tam ([GitHub](https://github.com/TimothyTam)) and [Benjamin Heng](https://github.com/benjaminheng). This project was developed as part of the [NUS Orbital programme](http://orbital.comp.nus.edu.sg/).

> Orbital is the School of Computingâ€™s self-driven programming summer experience.  It is  designed to give first-year students the opportunity to 1) self-learn and 2) build something useful.  It is designed as a 4 modular credit (MC) module that is taken pass/fail (CS/CU) over the summer.

# FAQ

**Why do I get `ExecJS::ProgramError` while trying to load the webpage on Windows?**

This is a known issue with ExecJS not working as expected on Windows machines using the default Javascript runtime. The easy fix is to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
